# Example of using Pyapp + Windows

To build the executable, simply run:

```powershell
./build_with_pyapp.ps1
```

in a powershell console. (You should be able to copy the file to a general project and only change the two variables at the top to get it to run.)

(It only runs on Windows right now, but it should be simple to adapt it to get it to run on Linux)
